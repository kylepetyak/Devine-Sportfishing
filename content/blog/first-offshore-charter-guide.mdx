If you've never been offshore fishing before, it's natural to have questions. What should you bring? What will the day look like? Will you get seasick?

After guiding hundreds of first-time offshore anglers, I've put together this guide to help you prepare for an amazing experience.

## Before Your Trip

### Get Your License
Louisiana requires a recreational fishing license for anyone 16 and older. You can purchase one online through the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries website. It takes just a few minutes and is valid immediately.

### Plan Your Meals
We recommend bringing:
- Plenty of water and sports drinks
- Snacks that travel well (granola bars, crackers, fruit)
- Lunch - sandwiches work great
- A small cooler to keep everything cold

Avoid heavy, greasy foods that might not sit well on the water. We have coolers on the boat for your food and drinks.

### Pack Smart
Essential items to bring:
- Sunscreen (SPF 30+ and waterproof)
- Polarized sunglasses
- Hat or visor
- Light, breathable clothing
- Long-sleeve shirt for sun protection
- Non-marking, non-slip shoes
- Rain jacket (weather changes quickly)
- Camera
- Seasickness medication if you're prone to motion sickness

We provide all fishing tackle, bait, ice, and fish coolers. You don't need to bring any fishing gear unless you have a specific rod you love to use.

## The Day Of

### Arrival
We typically meet at the marina before sunrise. This is when we'll go over safety procedures, discuss the plan for the day, and answer any questions. Don't be late - we want to maximize your fishing time.

### The Run Out
Depending on where we're fishing, the run to our first spot takes 30-90 minutes. This is a great time to enjoy the sunrise, look for dolphins, and mentally prepare for the day ahead.

### What We'll Do
A typical offshore day might include:
- Trolling for tuna, wahoo, or mahi-mahi
- Chunk baiting around oil platforms
- Bottom fishing for snapper or amberjack
- Live bait fishing for trophy species

We adapt our techniques based on conditions and what's biting. The goal is always to maximize your chances of catching fish.

### When You Hook Up
Here's what happens when a fish eats:
1. You'll hear us yell something like "Fish on!" or "Get on it!"
2. We'll hand you the rod (or you'll already be holding it)
3. Keep the rod tip up and reel when the fish lets you
4. Don't try to winch the fish in - let the rod do the work
5. Listen to our instructions - we'll guide you through the fight

Fighting a big fish is physically demanding but incredibly rewarding. Take your time and enjoy the experience.

## Common Concerns

### Will I Get Seasick?
Motion sickness is a real concern for many people. Here's how to minimize the risk:
- Get a good night's sleep before your trip
- Avoid alcohol the night before
- Take Dramamine or similar medication before departure
- Stay hydrated
- Keep your eyes on the horizon when possible
- Stay in the fresh air on deck

If you do feel queasy, let us know. We can often help, and there's no shame in it - even experienced anglers get seasick sometimes.

### What If I've Never Fished Before?
No problem at all. Many of our guests are complete beginners. We'll teach you everything you need to know - how to hold the rod, when to reel, how to fight a fish. That's our job, and we love doing it.

### What Happens to the Fish?
We clean and bag your catch at the end of the trip. You'll leave with fillets ready for cooking or freezing. If you're traveling by air, we can vacuum seal your fish for easier transport.

## After the Trip

### Tipping
Tipping your captain and mate is customary in the charter fishing industry. 15-20% of the trip cost is standard for a good experience. This is not required but is greatly appreciated.

### Photos and Memories
We encourage you to take lots of photos throughout the day. We'll help you get great shots with your catches. These memories are what it's all about.

### Book Your Next Trip
Most first-timers are hooked after one trip (pun intended). Many of our guests become regulars, returning year after year. There's always something new to catch.

## Ready to Go?

An offshore fishing charter is one of the most exciting outdoor experiences you can have. The combination of beautiful scenery, physical challenge, and the thrill of hooking into a big fish is hard to beat.

Don't overthink it. Come prepared, listen to your captain, and be ready for an adventure. We'll handle the rest.
