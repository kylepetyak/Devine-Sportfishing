There's nothing quite like cooking and eating fish you caught yourself. Redfish is one of our favorite species to target on inshore trips, and blackened redfish is the quintessential Louisiana way to prepare it.

This recipe was popularized by Chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s and has become a staple of Louisiana cuisine. The combination of butter, spices, and high heat creates a flavorful crust that's hard to beat.

## What You'll Need

### For the Blackening Seasoning
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### For the Fish
- 4 redfish fillets (6-8 oz each), skin removed
- 1/2 cup melted butter
- Cast iron skillet
- Good ventilation (this will smoke!)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Seasoning
Mix all the spices together in a small bowl. This makes enough for 4 fillets with some left over. Store extra seasoning in an airtight container.

### Step 2: Prepare the Fish
Pat the redfish fillets completely dry with paper towels. This is important for achieving a good crust. Dip each fillet in melted butter, coating both sides.

### Step 3: Season Generously
Sprinkle the blackening seasoning generously on both sides of each fillet. Press the seasoning into the fish.

### Step 4: Heat Your Skillet
Place a cast iron skillet over high heat for at least 10 minutes. The skillet needs to be extremely hot - almost smoking. This is essential for proper blackening.

**Important:** Do this outside on a grill burner if possible, or ensure excellent ventilation. Blackening creates significant smoke.

### Step 5: Cook the Fish
Working in batches if necessary:
1. Place seasoned fillets in the dry, screaming-hot skillet
2. Drizzle a teaspoon of melted butter on top of each fillet
3. Cook for 2-3 minutes until a dark crust forms
4. Flip carefully and repeat on the other side
5. Fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork

### Step 6: Serve Immediately
Transfer to plates and drizzle with remaining melted butter. Serve with:
- Dirty rice
- Coleslaw
- Lemon wedges
- Cold beer

## Tips for Success

**Get the skillet HOT:** The most common mistake is not heating the pan enough. If it's not smoking hot, you're not blackening - you're just cooking with spices.

**Use good ventilation:** Seriously, the smoke is intense. Outside is best. If cooking indoors, turn on your hood vent and open windows.

**Don't overcook:** Redfish cooks quickly at these high temperatures. Check the thickest part - when it just turns opaque and flakes, it's done.

**Fresh is best:** The fresher the fish, the better the result. Fish that came off your line hours ago will always taste better than anything from a store.

## Beyond Redfish

While redfish is traditional, this technique works great on other firm-fleshed fish:
- Speckled trout
- Red snapper
- Mahi-mahi
- Amberjack
